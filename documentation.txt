Now that you've learned the ins and outs of creating a RESTful API, you'll learn about how to make your API accessible and usable for other developers. In this course we will cover:

Good vs. Bad API Documentation
Practice writing API Documentation
Project Documentation
Finally, you'll complete some preparation for your final project in which you'll use all your skills to demonstrate your ability as an API developer.


Good API documentation
Good API documentation allows any developer considering the API to quickly understand the purpose of the API, the data it works with, and how to send requests and parse the responses. Some documentation, particularly for large projects, even host samples you can run within the documentation to see the API in action. For the purposes of this course, you don't need to implement interactivity, but you will provide examples that can be run by someone viewing your documentation.

Here's a recap (for your reference) of the components that are typically included in good API documentation:

Introduction
Getting Started
Base URL
API Keys /Authentication (if applicable)
Errors
Response codes
Messages
Error types
Resource endpoint library
Organized by resource
Include each endpoint
Sample request
Arguments including data types
Response object including status codes and data types





All good, well-documented projects have a README.md file that should clearly explain the project and how to get started with it to any developers who may want to use or contribute to the project. Depending on your personal style preferences and project type, the structure and exact contents will differ, but the structure below is a good starting place.

Project Title

Description of project and motivation
Screenshots (if applicable), with captions
Code Style if you are following particular style guides
Getting Started

Prerequisites & Installation, including code samples for how to download all pre-requisites
Local Development, including how to set up the local development environment and run the project locally
Tests and how to run them
API Reference. If the API documentation is not very long, it can be included in the README

Deployment (if applicable)
